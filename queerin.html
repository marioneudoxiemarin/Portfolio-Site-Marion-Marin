        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <p>
          Because of COVID 19, Pride Parades might be cancelled everywhere in the world. To help celebrate Pride online, Unicorns in Tech has organized a Digital Pride Hackathon.
          From May 15th to 7PM to May 17th 11AM, teams will work on a project benefiting LGBTQ+ people.

        <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <div class="row">
        <p>
          This was my first hackathon. This short deadline makes it definitely intense and requires a great deal of organisation and collaboration in the team.
          <br>It was challenging working with people with who I had a 9 hours time difference.
          <br>We are too limited on time to test the app with real users testings sessions. It's a challenge to only count on experience of the team to build the product.

          <h3>Step 1: Choosing a concept and form teams</h3>
          <div class="row">
          <p>
            Each hackathon participant had to select one concept and join a team.
            My team had 6 members (including myself).
            I was the only UX/UI Designer. Other team members were focusing on the business and copywriting aspects.
            The concept was to create a product who can help LGBTQ+ people to know where they are safe to be fully themselves without judgement and hate (doctors and psychologists offices, cafés, bars, restaurants, help centers).

            <h3>Step 2: Defining the Problem</h3>
            <div class="row">
            <ul>
              <li>No app providing a collection of LGBTQ+ friendly places</li>
              <li>On Google Maps, business owners can indicate their establishment as LGBTQ+ friendly but it’s rare and they are no ways to filter only those places</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>

            <h3>Step 3: Understanding The Users</h3>
            <div class="row">
            <p>
              In the case of a hackathon, we don’t have much time for research and no time for interviews so members of the team provided some experiences they lived themselves or from friends.
              Our users are represented through the following points:
              <b>Age:</b> 20 to 50s
              <b>Frustrations:</b> worried about homophobic incidents when going out in unknown places.
              <b>Wants & Needs:</b> to find LGBTQ+ friendly places to meet new people or/and safe places where they feel welcomed.

            <h3>Step 4: Brainstorming</h3>
            <div class="row">
            <p>
              We brainstormed together as a team on what elements the app could feature and their importance with online sticker notes.
              It gave us a direction for the project and a lot of inspiration for me as a UX Designer.

    <h3>Step 5: Paper Designs</h3>
    <div class="row">
    <p>
      During the brainstorming, a lot of ideas were formulated but for the purpose of the hackathon, I needed to be selective.
      I selected the most important ideas for the design to be feasible in 24 hours.
      The first drawings show how the main screens of the app will look like.

      <h3>Step 6: Final Design</h3>
      <div class="row">
      <p class="textcentered">
        Important elements of the design:
        <br>
        <br>Ability to filter the types of place and use other filters (price, languages, location)
        <br>2 types of rating: safety (with the red, orange, red points) and service (stars)
        <br>The ability to report a place if people have been harassed for being a LGBTQ+ member

      <h3>Result</h3>
      <div class="row">
      <p>
        All the projects for the Digital Pride Hackathon were judged by the 3 organizers and the other participants.
        <br>It was not judged only on design but also on the feasibility of the project and its impact on the LGBTQ+ community.
        <br>My team won <b>2nd place !</b>
        <br>It was very intense but also very rewarding. We worked really well with my team over that short time and we were proud of our work.
        I would definitely like to develop the project in the future.
