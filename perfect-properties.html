            The idea of this project is to bring something new to real
            estate apps.
            My goal was to find what is useful for users. What could be
            an asset in searching for a new home to buy?
            The UI part was very important here to further differentiate
            this app from many others. I wanted to attract users thanks
            to useful features as well as by a trustworthy and efficient
            visual design

            For this project, I was an Interaction Designer, a Visual

          <p>
            There are many apps for real estate on the market and most
            are well established.
            The challenge here was to bring something both new and
            useful to users.
            What feature was lacking in other apps? What were the
            main problems of users?

        <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
        <h3>Concept</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Target audience</b>: first time buyers, with middle to upper
            class salaries, in their 30s/40s, who want to invest for
            additional income or more financial security</li>
          <li><b>Competition</b>: there are a lot of different apps / websites
            which feature offers of properties to buy or rent</li>
          <li><b>Risk</b>: how to establish our app in a market where they are
            a lot of other similar products</li>
          <li><b>Opportunity</b>: focusing on buyers only is different from
            what is usually offered on similar popular products.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What are The Similar Apps on The Market?</h3>
        <p>
          There are lots of different apps providing users with
          information on houses to buy or rent such as Zillow,
          Realtor.com and Trulia in the United States. Here is what I
          found all those had in common during my research:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Users can rent or buy on those platforms</li>
          <li>Maps are a major component of their websites or apps</li>
          <li>There is a lot of information in their screens which can be
            overwhelming especially for first-time buyers</li>
          <li>There is a way to calculate how you afford the property on
            those apps which is often thought about by users before
            the actual search with a consultation with advisors, friends
            and their banks (it then might be a feature to remove here).</li>
          <li>They offer the possibility to book a visit of the house online
            which is useful and fast.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Problems and Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          I conducted two rounds of usability testing : one when the
          first wireframes were finished and and another one when
          the mid-fidelity ones were done.
          For the first round of testing, all sessions were conducted
          online via Skype because of COVID 19.
          Skype allowed for the participant to share their screen as
          well as to see their face which is great to see their reactions.
          For the second round, some sessions were still done on
          Skype and some were done face to face.
          For each round, I tested the app with 6 participants. Only
          the mobile app was tested since I followed a mobile-first
          approach.

          at this stage (neighborhood rating, financial filters)
          <br>
          <b>SOLUTION</b>: Based on the users comments, I lowered the
          number of filters removing the neighborhood and school
          ratings (which are still visible on the map for each property
          (see next screens). I also removed the financial aids filters as
          it seems that the users would prefer external help (bank,
          friends and family, advisors) to determine if a property is
          worth the investment.
          <br>
          <br>
          <b>PROBLEM</b>: It was important for the users to know which
          kind of parking was available and to know how many cars
          the garage could fit.
          <br>
          <b>SOLUTION</b>: It was added to the filters.

          <b>PROBLEM</b> : The users felt there was a lot of information on
          one page and that the important elements were not
          highlighted enough.
          <br>
          <b>SOLUTION</b>: The information is now presented on two
          different screens ("description" and "map"). The
          "description" screen show the important elements of the
          property like the filters, a description, the option to book a
          visit and recommendations. The "map" screen shows the
          map in a visually more attractive size and on this map, the
          users can see everything available around the property
          (restaurants, schools, parks, groceries stores, gyms).

          <b>PROBLEM</b>: During the testing, it was noted that if a lot of
          dates and time slots are available, the first version of the
          design would not be user friendly (it will be a long list of
          availabilities).
          <br>
          <b>SOLUTION</b>: Now, the user selects the date and a dropdown
          appears will the time slots available.
